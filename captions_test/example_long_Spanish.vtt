00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.540
hI i’M jOHN gREEN AND THIS IS cRASH cOURSE
eUROPEAN hISTORY.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.540
lAST TIME, WE LOOKED AT HOW THE MONARCHS DID--AND
DIDN’T--INCORPORATE THE IDEAS OF THE eNLIGHTENMENT

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.269
INTO THEIR DOMESTIC POLICIES.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.520
tODAY, WE’LL LOOK OUTWARD TO HOW THE 18TH
CENTURY eUROPEAN POWERS ENGAGED WITH EACH

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.039
OTHER AND BEYOND eUROPE--WHICH IS TO SAY THAT
WARFARE IS COMING.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.880
oR, CONTINUING, i SUPPOSE, BECAUSE IT NEVER
REALLY LEFT TOWN.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:37.719
[iNTRO]
sO, POPULATION WAS RISING IN 18TH CENTURY

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:44.210
eUROPE AND DESPITE AN EXTREMELY UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION
OF WEALTH AND LOTS OF WARTIME CASUALTIES,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.600
MANY PEOPLE WERE LEADING BETTER LIVES.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.680
fOR EXAMPLE, INVENTORIES OF fRENCH PEOPLE’S
POSSESSIONS SHOW THAT IN 1700 WOMEN OWNED

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.039
AN AVERAGE OF TWO GARMENTS GENERALLY IN SOLID
BLACK OR BROWN;

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.960
IN 1800 THAT NUMBER WAS FIVE GARMENTS OF MORE
VARIED, EVEN BRIGHT COLORS.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.140
nOW, THIS MAY SEEM LIKE MINOR PROGRESS, BUT
HERE’S ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT:
