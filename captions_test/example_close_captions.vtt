00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
All right, welcome to class today.
In our lab, we're going to do

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.960
a pumps lab, so this will
also come from the chapter 8 material.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.780
You might remember last
week we did pipeline

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.940
hydraulics, so this time
we'll do pump hydraulics.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.900
And we want to take
a few minutes here to kind

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.600
of set up some of
the measurements that we'll be taking.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.800
You see it best in the lab, but I think
it helps to see it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.600
also in a concept diagram first.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.860
So we've got a couple
of different sizes of pumps in

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.980
the lab, and we're going
to start with our large pump.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.310
And we're going to measure data.
If you want to look at

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.590
the handout, data sheet 1 is
what we'll be talking about now.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.970
We're going to measure
the pressure, for example,

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.050
the flow rate. It's
a variable frequency drive pump.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.710
So we're going to change the speed on the
motor, and that will

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.269
change how the pump behaves.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.510
And then we want
to determine the total dynamic

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.830
head and the power
at several different flow conditions.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.650
So just by a quick review, for total
dynamic head, we're going

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.350
to calculate that as
the lift, plus we want to account for

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.670
the pressure at the outlet of the pump.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.080
So pressure at the outlet,
and that'll be in PSI. We're

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.860
going to use TDH in
feet, so we'll need to convert.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.280
And to do that, you
might remember using the unit weight

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.580
of water, so gamma. So
in this case, 1 over gamma.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.640
In last week's lab,
we measured gamma, and it

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.900
turned out to be about 0.433 feet per PSI.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:13.980
In this case, we're
starting with PSI per feet.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:25.480
This time we're going to use
2.31, and that's feet per PSI.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.870
Okay, so we'll measure P out in PSI.
The units will cancel, so we'll be in

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.530
feet. We'll add the lift, which is in
feet, and that will give us the TDH.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.090
So we'll make a diagram
of how we'll collect that

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.890
data. This will be a
vertical cross-section of

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.290
our pumping system.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.970
So it's really our sump
that's our underground storage reservoir.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:13.920
And then we have our pump
with an impeller here and an inlet.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.070
And so we have flow coming out
up here. It'll be our flow rate Q.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.530
And we have a pressure transducer here,
or a pressure gauge, I should say.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.110
And then one of the important factors
is the water level in the reservoir.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.500
One of the things
that we'll notice is that

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.560
that water level changes
when we start the pump.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.100
And this is interesting partly
because it's the same in groundwater.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.200
When you first turn a pump on,
that water table starts

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.680
high and then lowers.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.860
And it's not as much here, but it's
enough we want to pay attention to that.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.340
So the initial water surface is
what we call the static water level.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.040
And then we let the pump run for a
couple of minutes, and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.279
then eventually it stops changing.
